# Algorithms
This project contains different Machine Learning and deep learning algorithm I coded myself.  Usually I like to code in different ways for learning purposes. Sometimes I code the same algorithm using python numpy, python pandas, object oriented style, java or whatever. This code repository will be associated with a blog that shows how you can learn to code these algorithms step by step. The blog link will be available soon

Currently I have the code of :

1- K-means using Python Numpy library
2- K-means using Python Panda ( 2 clusters case)
3- K-means using Python Panda (k cluster)
4- Mean Shift  (Numpy) ... Soon
5- K-medoid (Numpy) ... Soon
6- Genetic Algorithm (Matlab) ...Soon
7- Simulated Annealing (Java) ...Soon
8- Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (Java) ...Soon
